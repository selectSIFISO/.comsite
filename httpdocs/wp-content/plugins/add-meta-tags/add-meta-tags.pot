msgid "<em>Metadata</em> refers to information that describes the content in a machine-friendly way. Search engines and other online services use this metadata to better understand your content. Keep in mind that metadata itself does not automatically make your blog rank better. For this to happen the content is still required to meet various quality standards. However, the presence of accurate and adequate metadata gives search engines and other services the chance to make less guesses about your content, index and categorize it better and, eventually, deliver it to an audience that finds it useful.  Good metadata facilitates this process and thus plays a significant role in achieving better rankings. This is what the Add-Meta-Tags plugin does."

By default, the <em>description</em> and <em>keywords</em> meta tags are added to the front page, posts, pages, public custom post types, attachment pages, category, tag, custom taxonomy and author based archives. Furthermore, it is possible to enable the generation of <em>Opengraph</em>, <em>Dublin Core</em>, <em>Twitter Cards</em> and <em>Schema.org</em> metadata. The plugin also supports some extra SEO related functionality that helps you fine tune your web site."

Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question, but it depends on many factors. In general, low or mid traffic web sites would see very little benefit by using metadata caching. On the contrary, on high traffic web sites, and only in case WordPress has to load on every request, every millisecond counts and in this case the benefits can be great. On the other hand, regardless of the amount of the web traffic, in case a caching proxy server or a content delivery network (CDN) is used in front of your WordPress driven web site or if a plugin that produces static versions of your dynamic web pages is active, the benefits of metadata caching are minimal. In fact, in such cases caching metadata should rather be considered as a waste of even the little storage space that is used than a performance boost. Additionally, in very large multi-site WordPress installations, on which the superadmin does not have full control over the various blogs, under certain circumstances, metadata caching could lead to a significant increase of the used storage space in the database."
