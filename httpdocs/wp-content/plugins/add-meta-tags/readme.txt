A Free yet feature rich metadata plugin that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content.

== Description ==

_Add-Meta-Tags_ is a Free metadata plugin for the _WordPress Publishing Platform_ that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content. It achieves this by generating machine friendly information about your content, called **metadata**, according to widely used standard specifications. More specifically, _Add-Meta-Tags_ can generate the _description_ and _keywords_ meta tags, _Opengraph_, _Schema.org_ microdata and JSON+LD data, _Twitter Cards_ and _Dublin Core_ metadata for your _WordPress_ content and archives, your _WooCommerce_ products and product groups, _BuddyPress_ profiles, and more.

It also supports advanced _title customization_ letting you take control of the title generation on every part of the web site. Moreover, a basic _breadcrumb trail_ generator is provided for use with hierarchical post types. Last, but not least, it lets you customize the _locale_ on a per post basis generating a proper `hreflang` link for a signle language and, also, is out-of-the-box compatible with _WPML_ and _Polylang_ multilingual plugins (through the WPML language configuration file that ships with the plugin).

Add-Meta-Tags supports internal caching of the generated metadata of content and media pages and thus contributes to the preservation of system resources on high traffic web sites. Metadata caching can also lead to slightly faster page load times in several cases.

Add-Meta-Tags is actively maintained since 2006. Please visit the [Add-Meta-Tags historical homepage](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/).

This plugin is one of the personal software projects of George Notaras. It is developed in his free time and released to the open source WordPress community as Free software.

= Changelog Entries =

Please check out the changelog of each release by following the links below. You can also check the [roadmap](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/roadmap "Add-Meta-Tags Roadmap") regarding future releases of the plugin.

- [2.10.5](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/343)
 - Notice: The plugin has undergone several much needed improvements lately. I know frequent plugin updates make webmasters a little nervous, but all updates have been very safe. The implementation of two or three extra minor features has been planned (time permitting) for the upcoming weeks. Development during the upcoming months will take place at a much slower pace. Thanks all for contributing in one way or another!
 - Fixed an issue with the metadata cache clean up when the plugin settings were saved. The extra (undocumented!) 'timeout' entries WordPress automatically creates were not properly removed. Clearing the cache using the command line worked as expected. Although optional, it is recommended to save the plugin settings once so as to clear the metadata cache.
 - Metadata for posts that are not published is no longer cached. This was a design flaw. (Thanks to kochtopf for valuable feedback and testing.)
 - Improved the selection box for the main source of local author profiles. (Props to ditad for valuable feedback.)
 - Updated translations.
 - The `Esc` key can now be used to also open the metadata review panel, instead of just closing it, by adding the following in the `functions.php` file of the theme or in a [custom plugin](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Cookbook_Snippet_Uses#Custom-Plugin): `add_filter('amt_metadata_review_mode_enable_enhanced_script', '__return_true');`
- [2.10.4](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/342)
 - This bug fix release addresses an issue with Metadata Review Mode in cases javascript minification/compression is in effect due to missing dependency during the registration of the javascript file.
- [2.10.3](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/341)
 - Improved the metadata review mode menu item on the admin bar by adding a dashicon, which does not vanish in small screens. (Props to Kochtopf for ideas and valuable feedback.)
 - Minor improvements of the highlighter of the metadata in review mode.
 - The alternative metadata review mode via the admin toolbar panel has now become the default mode. Use `add_filter('amt_metadata_review_mode_enable_alternative', '__return_true');` to activate and use the old one.
 - The Metadata Review mode is now available on all pages and not just content pages.
 - Improved the title retrieval from posts in order to avoid having HTML within the title. For instance, Easy-Digital-Downloads returns HTML through the `get_the_title()` function. (Props to Mihai and the EDD support team for the hints.)
 - Fixed an issue with EDD category/tag archives which were also being identified by the plugin as products when the Schema.org JSON+LD generator was active.
 - Fixed issue with _Advanced Title Management_ which returned an empty title for custom post types under specific circumstances.
 - More updates of the Russian translation have now been included. Thanks Сергей Комков!
 - Used the default style/script enqueueing mechanism for the review mode styles and scripts. The `amt_metadata_review_mode_styles_scripts` hook has been removed. Please use the standard WordPress methods to enqueue custom styles and scripts.
 - Added [filter hooks](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Filter_and_Action_Hooks#Metadata-Review-Mode) and [action hooks](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Filter_and_Action_Hooks#Metadata-Review-Mode-2) that can be used to customize the data that is presented in the Metadata Review mode. You can now customize this data in any way you see fit, eg by adding your own summary or analysis.
- [2.10.2](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/340)
 - Important release notes: This release contains performance optimizations and should be the fastest release to date. The overhead of the generation of metadata for WordPress content should be significantly smaller. WooCommerce product and BuddyPress profile metadata still need work regarding performance. Please keep in mind that for the smallest overhead possible, you should enable metadata caching by setting a caching timeout greater than zero in the plugin settings (Caching does not work for BuddyPress profiles yet). To the best of my knowledge this release works as expected, but, since code written in the distant past has been slightly modified, I have to say that it would be a wise idea to first try it on a web site aimed for testing and that you should proceed with upgrading at your own risk. If you run a critical web site, it would be a good idea to wait for a while and check for feedback from users who have tried it. Your feedback is always welcome.
 - Notes about future plans: No major new features have been planned for the upcoming months and this is why these releases have focused on performance. Further support for bbPress, Easy-Digital-Downloads and other parts of BuddyPress except profiles will be delayed for a while. Upcoming releases will focus on bug fixes and minor improvements wherever necessary.
 - This release makes use of the non-persistent object caching mechanism of WordPress to optimize commonly used utility functions.
 - Updated the Turkish translation which is once again complete thanks to the work of Burak Yavuz. Many thanks! (I haven't updated the POT file with the new metadata caching related strings yet.)
 - The Russian translation has now been included in the release as it has reached 80% completeness thanks to the work of Сергей Комков and zxsergeant. Many thanks!
 - The _Metadata Review Mode_ has been improved and now contains the exact timings of the generation of the metadata blocks. (Props to Kochtopf for ideas and valuable feedback)
 - An alternative view for the _Metadata Review Mode_ has been added. By default, if _Metadata Review Mode_ has been enabled in the plugin settings, administrators can view a box containing the metadata within the post content. At this point, by adding `add_filter('amt_metadata_review_mode_enable_alternative', '__return_true');` in your theme's `functions.php` file you can switch to the alternative view. Notice the `Metadata` button in the admin toolbar on content pages (archives will be supported in the future). This view is experimental for now. Your feedback and improvements are welcome. You can use the `amt_metadata_review_mode_styles_scripts` filter hook to filter the default inline styles/scripts for this view (visible only to administrators and only if review mode has been enabled).
 - The generated _JSON+LD_ data is now compact and escaped. It still appears pretty printed in _Metadata Review Mode_ though.
 - Removed the 'experimental' label from metadata caching. This feature is robust enough and works as expected.
 - Timing information about the generated metadata blocks now appears at the top of the block.
 - Various minor improvements.
- [2.10.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/339)
 - Revised the help section about metadata caching. Added more information about the best practices when external storage backends are used for the transient data. Please, make sure you read it in order to better understand how metadata caching works in Add-Meta-Tags.
 - Improved the information, which is available in the plugin's settings panel, about the status of the metadata cache.
 - Made the `amt clean cache` command agnostic about the storage backend used for transient data and added a command line switch to the `amt clean` command for non interactive operation.
 - Fixed an issue which prevented the Metadata Review box from being added to the page. This issue affected only version 2.10.0 and did not affect any public page. (Props to kochtopf for reporting the issue and for providing valuable feedback.)
 - Google has recently revised the validation rules of their <em>Structured Data Testing Tool</em>. Many improvements of the Schema.org Microdata & JSON+LD generators have been implemented in this release in order to make the Schema.org metadata validate correctly. Please note that the <em>Yandex Structured Data Validator</em> still reports several errors. I'll provide more information about this in upcoming releases. (Props to TheSDTM for reporting the issues and for providing valuable feedback.)
 - Fixed an issue of the Schema.org JSON+LD generator with image attachment pages which resulted in the ImageObject having incorrect attribute structure.
 - All main Schema.org entities now have the `mainEntityOfPage` attribute set.
- [2.10.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/338)
 - Metadata caching using the WordPress Transients API has been implemented for metadata on content pages (posts, pages, attachments, products, custom content types, etc), on which even the small overhead of the generation of the metadata might be a problem on high traffic web sites. When turned on, this feature makes the addition of metadata to the pages blazing fast with minimal overhead at the expense of some storage space. Metadata of archives is not cached as the overhead of its generation is very small. This feature should be considered experimental and should only be used by experienced WordPress users. There are some cases in which this feature is useful and other cases it is not. Please read the _Metadata Caching_ section of the integrated help for more information, which will hopefully help you decide whether you need this or not.
 - Added option to display timing information under each metadata block so as to have a rough indication of how Add-Meta-Tags performs in your environment. Make no mistake, this is not a benchmark. These timings can vary even in consecutive requests of the same web page and heavily depend on your specific server environment.
 - Added detailed documentation about metadata caching to the integrated help.
 - Metadata caching can be deactivated (forced) and its relevant settings can be hidden using a filter based switch (Return true/false to `amt_enable_metadata_cache` hook). Can be useful in some cases.
 - Removed the _experimental_ label from the _Advanced Title Management_ feature.
 - Removed the _experimental_ label from the JSON+LD Schema.org generator.
 - Removed the _word-in-progress_ label from the BuddyPress profile metadata generator.
 - Updated the `amt` command of `wp-cli` to support crearing the metadata cache from the command line. Read the integrated help for more information about how the metadata cache can be cleared.
 - Updated translations.
 - Various minor improvements.
 - Notice 1: No new features have been planned for implementation in the near future. Releases during the upcoming months will focus on performance improvements and bug fixes whereever necessary. Your feedback is welcome.
 - Notice 2: The file and directory layout of the plugin might change in future releases. If for any reason this is going to affect your workflow, please let me know.
- [2.9.12](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/337)
 - The *custom title* feature is now fully backwards compatible with older themes, which set the page title using the `wp_title()` template tag instead of implementing the `title-tag` theme feature, when used with WordPress 4.4. Admittedly, this should have been resolved before the WordPress 4.4 release, so apologies for any inconvenience. The plugin is tested with the latest default theme, so this issue had not been brought to my attention before the WordPress 4.4 release. Also, the changes WordPress 4.4 brought in this area hadn't been clear enough so as to know there was going to be a problem beforehand. Big thanks to all who have provided feedback.
 - Notice 1: No new features have been planned for implementation in the near future. Releases during the upcoming months will focus on performance improvements and metadata caching and bug fixes whereever necessary. Your feedback is welcome.
 - Notice 2: The file and directory layout of the plugin might change in future releases. If for any reason this might affect your workflow, please let me know.
- [2.9.11](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/336)
 - Fixed issue with WordPress 4.4 not using the custom title as expected. <strike>Backwards compatibility is maintained.</strike> Please read the following comment of mine about [how to update old themes for the WordPress 4.4 Title-Tag feature](https://github.com/gnotaras/wordpress-add-meta-tags/issues/15#issuecomment-163716554). (Props to efishinsea for reporting the issue.)
- [2.9.10](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/333)
 - Added the filter hook `amt_get_queried_object` that can be used to modify the post object that is used by the plugin for metadata generation, a feature that opens the path for support of external post types like those used by _AnsPress_. (Props to Dima Stefantsov for valuable feedback, research and code contribution.)
 - Reverted back to the old way of loading the plugin text domain for translations. Translations are now loaded as expected. (Props to Burak Yavuz for valuable feedback.)
 - The plugin options are no longer deleted on uninstallation. Please use the `amt` command of `wp-cli` to clean up data. 
 - Added filter based switches that can be used to easily [turn off metadata generation](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Filter_and_Action_Hooks#Metadata-exclusion) for all supported types of metadata.
 - Updated translations.
- [2.9.9](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/306)
 - Fixed issue with Schema.org microdata generator which did not take options into account while generating the author's Person entity. This issue affects the last two releases.
 - Updated translations.
 - Minor improvements.
- [2.9.8](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/305)
 - Refactoring of Schema.org generators for BuddyPress metadata.
 - More profile properties are now supported by the Schema.org generators. Please check the [BuddyPress Metadata Customization Guide](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Custom_Content#Metadata-for-BuddyPress) for more information. The docs now include information about how to modify or extend the generated BuddyPress metadata, override the default field map or prevent profile metadata from being added to the profile page.
 - Various improvements of the BuddyPress metadata generators. (Props to HansRuedi Keller for valuable feedback)
 - Fixed issue with author URL for Google+ which appeared on pages without author. (Props to HansRuedi Keller for valuable feedback)
 - Added support for checks of the privacy setting of each field of the BuddyPress extended profiles.
 - Fixed the BuddyPress profile URL. The profile slug is now taken into account.
 - Allow filtering of the generated local profile url through the `amt_get_local_author_profile_url` filter hook.
 - Fixed various minor issues.
 - Updated translations.
- [2.9.7](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/304)
 - Notice: The file/directory layout might change in upcoming releases.
 - Added support for the generation of metadata for _BuddyPress Profiles_. Please consult the _Extended Metadata_ section in the integrated help for more information about this new feature. This feature should be considered work in progress. Title customization is not supported yet. Many thanks to HansRuedi Keller for ideas, valuable feedback and for helping me raise my "BuddyPress IQ" at _lerngruppen.net_.
 - Added support for configurable source of local author profiles. Add-Meta-Tags, by convention, due to the lack of public profile pages in WordPress, treats the first page of the author archive as the author's profile page. This is now configurable. Please check the _Author Settings_ section in the integrated help for more information before changing this as it affects some parts of the metadata.
 - Added the `amt_local_author_profile_url()` template tag which generates a URL to the local author profile according to the relevant selection in the Add-Meta-Tags settings.
 - Added the base mechanism for bbPress support. This feature is at a very early stage of developement.
 - Various improvements of the integrated help.
 - Minor improvements of the administration interface.
 - Fixes of various minor issues.
- [2.9.6](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/303)
 - This release implements the `amt` community command of [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/). Downloading `wp-cli` is required. Learn more about the [Add-Meta-Tags command line interface](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Command_Line_Interface). This feature should be considered experimental and is currently meant to be used in testing environments, even if it seems to work fine.
 - Decoupled the *WebSite* and *Organisation* Schema.org entities on the homepage, as it is unclear whether the various services interpret them correctly when nested. Furthermore, more research about how these two entities could be nested is required. The default homepage is the only page on which Add-Meta-Tags prints decoupled schema.org objects.
 - Fixed an issue of the excerpt generator, which in some cases could reinsert shortcodes (eg Visual Composer shortcodes) and HTML tags in the excerpt. Kudos to Ceslav Przywara for spotting it and for providing useful and detailed feedback.
 - Reverted back to one-argument version of the `amt_custom_title_tag()` filtering function in order to maintain backwards compatibility. Props to Cat for reporting the issue.
 - Removed the `headline` itemprop from *Product* schema.org entities.
- [2.9.5](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/302)
 - The *Advanced Titles* feature now properly supports the management of titles of custom post type archives.
 - Metadata is now generated for archives of custom post types.
 - Reverted back to the old check of the version of the plugin settings which properly upgrades the settings whever necessary without having to access the admin interface. (props to Eddie McHam for providing useful feedback about this issue)
 - Updated the [theme requirements](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Requirements#Theme-Requirements).
 - Added extra filter that removes shortcodes which have not been properly registered using the WordPress Shortcode API.
 - Some minor modifications which should result in slightly better performance in some cases.
- [2.9.4](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/301)
 - Updated translations. The plugin now ships with a complete Greek translation. Big thanks to Michael Kotsarinis for contributing to the project!
- [2.9.3](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/300)
 - The full meta tags field is now set as translatable in the wpml-config.xml file. (props to Werner Grunberger for feedback)
 - Re-added the %title% tag expansion functionality in the custom title. (props to ndrwpvlv for feedback)
- [2.9.2](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/299)
 - Advanced SEO title management and customization has been built into Add-Meta-Tags. Needs to be enabled in the settings. Read [more info](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Advanced_Title_Management) about how to customize the titles. This feature is currently marked as experimental. Your feedback is welcome.
 - Option to force the use of the content's custom title, if one has been set in the post editing screen, in the titles within the metadata. By default the custom title is used only for the 'title' HTML element. (Props to fatherb, bolt24, vtinath, Craig Damon and others)
 - Fixed missing schema.org properties of video schema.org objects. (Props to Dragos for reporting the issue and for useful feedback)
 - Fixed several translatable strings. (Props to Burak Yavuz for valuable feedback.)
 - Dublin Core generator follows media item limits. (Props to Eduardo Molon for feedback.)
 - Internal media limit (configurable via filter) increased from 10 to 16. (Props to Eduardo Molon for feedback.)
 - Minor improvements of the schema.org metadata generators.
- [2.9.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/298)
 - The Twitter Cards, Opengraph and Schema.org microdata and JSON+LD generators for WooCommerce products have been greatly improved and are ready for general testing.
 - Updated the Turkish translation. (props to BouRock for tirelessly maintaining the Turkish translation)
 - Fixed issues of the JSON-LD generator with product and product group metadata. (props to Justin Flores for valuable feedback)
 - Review mode box no longer shows message about microdata when the JSON+LD generator is enabled. (props to Eduardo Molon for providing feedback)
 - Various other minor fixes and enhancements.
- [2.9.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/297)
 - **IMPORTANT NOTICE 1**: All help text messages and examples of the settings page have been moved to the integrated WordPress help system. This has been done in order to make the settings page easier to navigate. While at the settings page, press the `HELP` button on the top right corner and browse through the various sections in order to get detailed information about the available settings.
 - **IMPORTANT NOTICE 2**: It is no longer possible to enter the URLs of the Publisher's social media profiles in the WordPress user profile pages. Instead, publisher information should be entered in the relevant fields of the **Publisher Settings** section of the settings page.
 - The administration interface has been reworked.
 - Removed publisher related settings from user profile pages.
 - Improved the algorithm that collects the embedded media so that it excludes media which are just linked from the content and not embedded into the content.
 - Added option that limits the generated media metadata to one media file of each media type (image, video, audio). See `Media Limit` in the settings page. (thanks all for providing feedback about this feature - too many to list here)
 - Added support for pre-defined full meta tag sets, which can be used in the 'Full Meta Tags' box ([more info](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Plugin_Functionality_Customization#Create-Pre-Defined-Full-Meta-Tag-Sets)). (props to aferguson for ideas and feedback)
 - Re-invented the 'Express Review' feature. Admittedly, creating a review has become a little more complex, but the new way of creating reviews is as simple as it can possibly get without sacrificing flexibility. If you have an idea about how to make it even simpler, please let me know.
 - This release contains an alpha version of JSON-LD schema.org metadata generator. By enabling it in the settings, schema.org metadata is added in the head section of the web page as an `application/ld+json` script, instead of embedded microdata in the content. This feature currently exists only for testing. Your feedbackis welcome.

Changelog information for older releases can be found in the ChangeLog file or at the [roadmap](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/roadmap "Add-Meta-Tags Roadmap") on the [Add-Meta-Tags development web site](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags).
